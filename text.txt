Key points:- reconcillation is the technique which used to compare the difference between two 'Virtual DOM' means one dom of react and another dom of browser.

Props:-Props are nothing but the information that we pass to a jsx tag in another words its a property of compoments.

for connecting css file from folder import '../ComponentStyles/product.css';

for version 3 of tailwindcss/postcss:- npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
and then, npx tailwindcss init -p

tailwind.config.js:- /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

postcss.config.js:-export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}

for index.css:- @tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

Note:- if we want to execute any function by own then use callback function and avoid direct function.

  1.) whenever we wants to delete something in React, use 'filter' method.
  2.) And if we need to render or get elements of arrey for list, use 'map' method, we can also use map method when we required to change every elements of array.

React router dom installation:- install react-router-dom

Note:- In react, we dont use "a-tag" for image because, it reload the page so instead of this, we use Link tag.

Note:- UseEffect a hook is used for re-rendering some conditions or methods. In simple word, if we want to get something based on rendering of useState on some conditions, we use UseEffect. Let supppose you want to print hello world or something like that based on some changes of variables or something, we can do like that. Also, in useEffect, we have two things one is methods or function through which you want something and another one is dependencies and that dependency is nothing but the states on which you want to check your useEffect.It means, suppose you have two useStates and by default you havn't set any dependencies in your useEffect so if any variables or anything will change then useEffect will get trigger and executes but if you want to run your useEffect only on some or accordingly useStates variable then you can set that useState as dependency in useEffect. visit 'Counter.jsx' file from 'Form' project of 'basicProjects'.

Note:- In react, there is a dependency that is 'react-router-dom' which gives a method 'Outlet' through which we can set our outlet for page, like if we want to fix some components of page then we can use outlet method. Use chat gpt for more or also you can check Layout.jsx file of reactRouter project.

Context Api:- Basically, in one line, the context api is used to share the data globally, without even props

Important Note:- In themeChanger project make sure to add 'darkMode: "class"' in tailwind.config.js

Note:- Handling multiple useState. So, if you have 1 or 2 input or something whose value you wants to update so you can use individual useState for each. But if required multiple useState so for this we will make a single useState for handling all the useStates by passing an object,{} and inside object we can simply pass the useStates variables. (see the Form.jsx of 'Form' project)..
